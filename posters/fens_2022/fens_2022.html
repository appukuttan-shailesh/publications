      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
      Computational approaches to neuroscience, such as development of models and data analysis, lack an established
      system for distributing code, data and other related resources. The absence of such a system significantly
      diminishes the utility of scientific outputs such as published models and datasets within the neuroscience
      community, and also hinders the reproducibility of data analyses. This has also severely impeded the promotion and
      progress of community-based, collaborative modelling efforts. We present here an online platform, called EBRAINS
      Live Papers, for sharing scientific resources in neuroscience. It aims to enable researchers to easily access the
      data resources employed in published studies and understand in detail the provenance of published results and
      figures.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Methods</strong><br />
      All Live Paper related info is stored in the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph (KG). The KG, being a graph-based database,
      interlinks all data units thereby readily offering a high degree of data provenance. This also allows for tighter
      integration with other tools and services offered under the EBRAINS ecosystem.
      Live papers can be built using the integrated Live Paper Builder tool. This allows authors to create rich,
      interactive web pages without requiring any web development skills, by simply entering info in a form-based
      interface. The tool also allows for automated extraction of metadata from manuscripts. The tool allows for easily
      linking to resources in community databases such as EBRAINS, NeuroMorpho.org (Ascoli et al., 2007), ModelDB (Hines
      et al., 2004), the Allen Brain
      Atlas (Sunkin et al., 2012), thereby acting as an integrator of scientific resources spanning diverse data types
      such as models,
      morphologies, electrophysiological data and Jupyter notebooks.
      <br /><br />
      Live papers, prior to their publication, can also be password-protected. This allows restricting access to desired
      user groups such as to reviewers of an associated manuscript during its review phase. Additionally, the EBRAINS
      platform issues Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for curated and published Live Papers. This promises to
      incentivise researchers to publish and share such resources, while ensuring that they are duly acknowledged when
      these resources are utilized.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Results</strong><br />
      EBRAINS Live Papers are interactive documents bringing together code, models, and data. They can be developed to
      be stand-alone publications, but more frequently complement published scientific articles by providing access to
      the underlying models, data or analyses.
      <br /><br />
      Interactivity is a prominent feature of the “Live Papers” with several integrated tools and services that allow
      users to download, visualise or simulate data, models and results presented in the corresponding publications. A
      more complete picture of the original researchers’ workspace is reconstructed by bringing together these various
      resources underlying computational approaches in neuroscience publications.
      <br /><br />
      Researchers from the Human Brain Project have already published over 20 live papers with interactive supplementary
      material for their published papers in Nature Communications, PNAS, PLOS Computational Biology, eLife and other
      journals.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Conclusions</strong><br />
      Live Papers are intended at making neuroscience publications more valuable to the scientific community by offering
      a holistic view of the various digital components of a publication, such as data analysis code, the data
      underlying model development, or simulation results. The availability and accessibility of underlying code and
      data will enable reviewers and other scientists to better evaluate and/or employ a given model or analysis. With
      the concept of Live Papers presented here, we have hoped to establish a platform by means of which authors can
      easily aggregate the various data components underlying their computational study into a systematic, structured
      and distributable format.
